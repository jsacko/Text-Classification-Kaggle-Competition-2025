# text-classification-kaggle-competition
This repository contains my solution notebook for a Kaggle competition organized by Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Google. The challenge focuses on detecting rule-violating comments across different subreddits using transformer-based NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) implemented with TensorFlow and Hugging Face.
