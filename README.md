# Text-Classification-Kaggle-Competition
This repository contains my solution notebook for a Kaggle competition organized by Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Google. The challenge focuses on detecting rule-violating comments across different subreddits using transformer-based NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa, DeBERTa) implemented with TensorFlow and Hugging Face. The work includes data preprocessing, cross-validation, model training, and out-of-fold evaluation.
